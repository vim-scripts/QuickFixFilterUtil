When grepping I don\\&#039t want to get the files stored by the version control system. That\\&#039s why I\\&#039ve written this script to remove those matches. 
It can also be used to replace filenames (cygwin problem)..
If you are unsure which and how many files have been removed just invoke :LogShowAll and rerun.
